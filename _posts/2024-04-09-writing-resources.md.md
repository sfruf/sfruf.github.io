2. This is particularly about writing but I found identifying who I am as a writer in this answer to super useful to identify my editing super power. Particularly the section "The Two Types of Rewrites"
[Venkatesh Rao on Tips for Advanced Writing](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-for-advanced-writers-How-do-you-push-your-writing-into-excellency-territory/answer/Venkatesh-Rao)

3. My favorite resource on science writing. Dives into making your writing match the expectations of the audience. A much deeper dive into the kind of thinking-writing that Venkatesh Rao describes in 2. 
[The Science of Science Writing](https://www.americanscientist.org/blog/the-long-view/the-science-of-scientific-writing)


4. Good overview of a blogging process, describing a method to consistently get ideas out.
