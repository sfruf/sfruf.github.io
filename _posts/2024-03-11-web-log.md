I was inspired to web-log by Cory Doctorow's !(reflection on his blog Pluralistic)[https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/]. He points to the history of the word blog, a shortening of web-log, as the source of a "platonic ideal" of a blog, showing "the blog as an annotated browser-history, like the travelerâ€™s diaries my family kept on vacations." 

I've attempted to blog in various forms and have gotten caught up in the hype of what a blog should be. The title optimization, SEO, followers chasing, what have you. I'm trying to do it again, and do it the !("long, slow, stupid, fun way")[https://newsletter.pathlesspath.com/p/the-long-slow-stupid-fun-way-259]. 

Hence the rinky dink site. Hence the web-log and not the blog.
