I've been obsessed with this clip from Limmy's Show:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GceNsojnMf0

In the clip, someone off camera yells "cut!" and the crew of the shoot come in to verify what the host is claiming (there's free water in the tap). And they're like amazed (watch the clip!).

In improv, we often have people yell "cut!" from the side and then come in and negate the reality that the performer has been building or comment on how bad their performance is. This clip shows another possibility: we can use the cut to add to the reality and heighten what's already been established.
