I love a good list. There's something so satisfying about the groove of a good list. So I'm collecting a list of lists here, only my favorites. 

In _Energy and Eros: Teachings on the Art of Love_, James N. Powell describes the skills required of courtesans in Ancient India:

“A cultured woman was expected to have a sound knowledge of sixty-four auxiliary arts in order to be considered a good lover. These talents included singing, playing musical instruments, dancing, painting, decorating one’s forehead, the art of adorning an idol with rice and flowers, flower arranging, bed making, garland weaving, the art of designing earrings and other ornaments, the art of mixing perfumes for the skin in order to stimulate sexual desire, the art of dressing tastefully, magic and sleight of hand, cooking, the preparation of sherbets and other beverages, sewing, the solution of riddles, the art of reciting verses in a game between lovers, mimicry, reasoning and logic, chanting, fencing, carpentry, gardening, teaching parrots to speak, composing poems, and the art of sizing up a man in a glance.”

In _The Book of Delights_ by Ross Gay, he lists his nicknames:

"I am a bit of a nickname magnet and have been assigned the following aliases -- Bizquick, Biz, Raheem (the compassionate), Beef, Beefie, Big Man, Bigs, Biggie, Big lil Big, Big Poppa, The Big Gay, Bone, Babyboy, Babygay, The Baby, Booger, Beast, Sammy, Sossy, Saucy, Sauce, Saucypants, Dr. Sauce, Dr. Hot Sauce, Doc, The Doctor, Tall Lady, Tall Drink, Wave, Arroz (con pollo), Ross the Boss the King of Applesauce, Rosski, Snozzers, Six, Seis, Unky, Daddy, and several others too lewd or private to share."
