When I first started engaging with writing on the internet (substacks and what have you) the idea of doing something similar felt so daunting. Writers churning out posts like clockwork to what one can only assume are infinity devoted fans. 

Lurking in this part of the internet for a while now, it's clear that these writers are just people trying their best. They're figuring it out. 

They're figuring out their schedule, announcing or apologizing for a break in posting. 

They're figuring out their style, changing formats and who they talk to. 

They're figuring out what's important, stopping. 

I tend to imagine that everyone else has it all figured out, in part because they're doing the thing I wish I was doing. There's hope in seeing people figure things out, because it reminds me that I just need to start. 

Start doing the thing I want to do, and then I'll be doing it. Magic.
