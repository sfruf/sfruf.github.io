There's a particular class of Science Fiction that I really enjoy. One where the boundlessness of space gives us a chance to reflect on humanities place in the universe. They make me feel both small compared to the infinity of space and connected to the long line of humans that made it possible to exist as a mote in the maelstrom. 

Here are some books that gave me a chance to feel that feel. 

[Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/25499718) 
An attempt to terraform a planet for human habitation goes wrong and produces a race of hyper intelligent spiders. We get to see the spider society evolve and come into contact with the last remnants of humanity. So much good stuff in here, I had multiple "oh that is how a spider society would work" moments. 

[A Fire Upon the Deep by Vernor Vinge](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77711.A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep) An ancient evil is unleashed upon the universe and one last crew might just be able to stop it. A lot of the book takes place of a galactic version of a message board and there's a fun aspect of research that goes along with that, which connects the current into the deep past.
