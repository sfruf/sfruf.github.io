I recently read Guy Raz's *How I Built This* book, a companion to his very popular podcast. I mostly enjoyed the book, Raz brings in a lot of stories from the podcast to help frame the process and pitfalls of entrepreneurship. 

The underlying premise of the How I Built This podcast, and by proxy the book, is that entrepreneurship stories should be told as a hero's journey. One thing that struck me as I was reading the book was that this relies on a societal understanding of entrepreneurs as heros.
