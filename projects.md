# Improv

I've been doing improvised theater for over a decade and have recently started dancing Contact Improv. I'm part of various groups and have an improvised solo show called Party of One. Here's a bio and headshot from a recent production.

Sebastian (he/him) has improvised in Boston, Chicago, the Bay Area, Atlanta, and Saudi Arabia over the past eleven years. He's taken a beginner improv class in all those cities and is hopeful he'll get it in the next one. You can see him performing his solo show Party of One on any unoccupied surface and sometimes stages. He loves physicality, emotional scenes, and being a silly goose. Please talk to him about improv.

# Somatics and Embodied Knowledge

I've been studying Tai Chi for the past decade as well as other physical disciplines and I'm always trying to find was to help people get more into their bodies. A lot of my writing is focused around this and I'm starting to develop some workshops.
