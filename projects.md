# Improv

I've been doing improvised theater for over a decade and have recently started dancing Contact Improv. I'm part of various groups and have an improvised solo show called Party of One. Here's a bio and headshot from a recent production.

Sebastian (he/him) has improvised in Boston, Chicago, the Bay Area, Atlanta, and Saudi Arabia over the past eleven years. He's taken a beginner improv class in all those cities and is hopeful he'll get it in the next one. You can see him performing his solo show Party of One on any unoccupied surface and sometimes stages. He loves physicality, emotional scenes, and being a silly goose. Please talk to him about improv.
